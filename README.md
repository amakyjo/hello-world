# hello-world
This repository is to store ideas and resources regarding my current quest to learn new technologies by spending at least 2 hours daily to learn something new
My name is Joy, I am a Software Automation Engineer with over 5 years of automation experience. Recently I develop this interest of spending at least 2 hours every day to learn something new in the IT world, be it a topic, a tool or a technology stack. I long to cover the knowlege gap I have with regards to new technologies in the coming months.
